             *
             *              It's made this way because in some cases the image paths (or other assets)

             *              This does create duplicated images because, if there is something like:
             *              - <img src=""> then vite knows how to resolve it and actually exported js file will use the
             *     default asset,
             *              - <component :prop> Vite doesn't care so the asset path will remain unchanged, thus the copy
             *     `dest` path will be used

             *              Important here is that:
